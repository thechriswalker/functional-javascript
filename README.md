My solutions to the functional-javascript-workshop (e.g. `npm install -g functional-javascript-workshop`)

I was gutted to find out that my solution to the `hello world` which I though was insanely clever, actually
turned out to be one of the later challenges, and not as original as I thought...

I had trouble with the trampoline, had to brush up on tail call optimisation...

Otherwise, fun and interesting.
